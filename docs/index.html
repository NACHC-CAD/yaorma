			<h1>YAORMA: Yet Another Object Relation Mapping Architecture</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to the YAORMA project.  
				Yaorma is an extremely streamlined and simple to use Object Relation Mapping tool suite.  
				Yaorma provides a code generator that will generate a one-to-one mapping of relational database tables to Java Data Valu Objects (DVOs).  
				Yaorma also provides tools to connect to a database, execute queries, marshal database data into simple to use data structures,
				populate the Yaorma DVOs from database query results, 
				and use DVOs to write data to databases.  
			</p>

			<h3>Yaorma Components</h3>
			<p>
				Yaorma is a series of components that can be used individually or as an integrated components.  
				The components most often directly used by applications using Yaorma are shown below.  
			</p>

			<table class="table">
				<!-- table headers -->
				<tr>
					<th>Resource</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
				<!-- end-to-end -->
				<tr>
					<td>
						<nobr>
							<a href="./pages/components/end-to-end/EndToEnd.html">End-to-end</a>
						</nobr>
					</td>
					<td>
						An end-to-end example of Yaorma use is given here.  
						This is not a complete example as there is other functionality in Yaorma that can be used to perform similar processes to those described here.  
						For example, here we use the findBySql function of the DAO class.  
						The DAO class supports other ways of querying and marshaling data.  
						See the component page for the DAO for details.
